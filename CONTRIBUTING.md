## Adding an item to the list

All new items to the list should adhere to the following

- Only suggest items that you have consumed and can make a personal comment about. If you are curious about a particular piece of media, open an issue to see if anyone else recommends it.
- The entry should contain the title and creator links, publication year (or publication run for ongoing media), rating, description, and your personal commentary.
	- For books and short stories, the creator will be the author(s) of the book. For comics, please include the illustrator alongside the author. For movies, please include the director.
	- For books, comics, and short story collections please copy the description and rating from [Goodreads](https://goodreads.com) and link to the Goodreads entry.
	- For movies and TV shows, please copy the description and rating from [IMDb](https://imdb.com) and link to the IMDb entry.
	- Please link the creator's [Wikipedia](https://wikipedia.org) page. If no such page exists, it should point to the creator's [Goodread's](https://goodreads.com) or [IMDb](https://imdb.com) page. If no such links exist, please leave the creator name in plain text instead of including a link.
- Use the following format:

```

Commentary - [@you](https://github.com/you)

> Description
```

- Please add the entry to the correct section. If you are not sure which section a work belongs to, put it in the general Horror/Thriller section.
- Please add your name and the link to your github next to your commentary. Pull requests without a personal comment will not be merged.
- Start the description with a capital and end with a full stop/period.
- Please check the list to make sure you do not submit a duplicate item. (However, feel free to add your personal comments to existing items.)
- Make an individual pull request for each suggestion.
- Please be as descriptive as possible with pull request titles and commit messages.
- Categories are encouraged but not required. Categories should use inline code ticks and be whitespace delimited.

```
Categories: `gothic horror` `psychological thriller` `camp`
```
- Please make sure you eliminate trailing whitespace before submitting a pull request.

Thank you for adding a new suggestion!
