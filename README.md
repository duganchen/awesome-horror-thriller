## Novels

#### [Dracula](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34810834-dracula) (1897) *by [Bram Stoker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bram_Stoker)* [3.97] ðŸŒŸðŸ”¥

Categories: `gothic` `horror`

No list of great horror works would be complete without *Dracula*. This is a stunning example of epistolary novels done right, gothic horror done right, and defined an entire genre unto itself. If you are only familiar with Dracula through film or general pop culture references, I can't recommend the source material enough. I knew the basic story beats well before I ever picked the book up, and it still managed to suck me in. If audiobooks are your thing, definintely dry out the Audible full cast recording.

> When Jonathan Harker visits Transylvania to help Count Dracula with the purchase of a London house, he makes horrifying discoveries about his client and his castle. Soon afterwards, a number of disturbing incidents unfold in England: an unmanned ship is wrecked at Whitby; strange puncture marks appear on a young womanâ€™s neck; and the inmate of a lunatic asylum raves about the imminent arrival of his â€˜Masterâ€™. In the ensuing battle of wits between the sinister Count Dracula and a determined group of adversaries, Bram Stoker created a masterpiece of the horror genre, probing deeply into questions of human identity and sanity, and illuminating dark corners of Victorian sexuality and desire.

#### [The Haunting of Hill House](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/89717.The_Haunting_of_Hill_House) (1959) *by [Shirley Jackson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shirley_Jackson)* [3.89] ðŸŒŸ

Categories: `gothic` `horror`

A classic of the genre, The Haunting of Hill House is a must read for anyone looking to build their horror repitorie. Calling this deeply psychological and discordant novel a haunted house story simply does it a disservice. It helped establish so many tropes of the genre, yet feels timeless. I find something new every time I read it. - [@thejessleigh](https://github.com/thejessleigh)

> First published in 1959, Shirley Jackson's The Haunting of Hill House has been hailed as a perfect work of unnerving terror. It is the story of four seekers who arrive at a notoriously unfriendly pile called Hill House: Dr. Montague, an occult scholar looking for solid evidence of a "haunting"; Theodora, his lighthearted assistant; Eleanor, a friendless, fragile young woman well acquainted with poltergeists; and Luke, the future heir of Hill House. At first, their stay seems destined to be merely a spooky encounter with inexplicable phenomena. But Hill House is gathering its powersâ€”and soon it will choose one of them to make its own.

#### [Hannibal](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2243973) (2013-2015) *by [Bryan Fuller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryan_Fuller)* [8.6] ðŸ”¥

Categories: `crime` `drama` `psychological thriller`

Hannibal is something of a tone poem. The character development and relationships at the core of the show are the stars here. The show manages to keep you engaged and terrified despite knowing from popular culture where Hannibal Lecter ends up. Plus, the food cinematography is amazing and disturbing. [@thejessleigh](https://github.com/thejessleigh)

> Explores the early relationship between the renowned psychiatrist and his patient, a young FBI criminal profiler, who is haunted by his ability to empathize with serial killers.

## Comic Books

#### [Through the Woods](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18659623-through-the-woods) (2014) *by [Emily Carroll](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emily_Carroll)* [3.92]

Categories: `horror` `fairy tale`

Emily Carroll does amazing things with color to create a sense of disquiet from the very beginning. I loved the way that she played with sound and movement in some of her panel-less pages. Her stories have a fairy tale quality to them, so each one feels both familiar and new at the same time. This is a beautiful collection full of eerie and unsettling stories. Great for anyone who misses what it feels like to the Grimm's fairy tales for the first time. [@thejessleigh](https://github.com/thejessleigh)

> Five mysterious, spine-tingling stories follow journeys into (and out of?) the eerie abyss.
These chilling tales spring from the macabre imagination of acclaimed and award-winning comic creator Emily Carroll.
Come take a walk in the woods and see what awaits you there.
