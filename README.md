## Novels

#### [Bird Box](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22350224-bird-box) (2014) *by [Josh Malerman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Malerman)* [3.98]

Categories: `horror` `post-apocalyptic` `psychological`

This is a book I read in one sitting, and stayed up late in order to do so. This is a thrilling novel that toys with the reader's senses. For a large part of the story, the characters cannot see, and there is little to no visual description. Rather, it relies on the other four senses to push the story forward. This is one of the most tense and addictive stories I've ever read. I wish I could experience it again for the first time. - [@sunrein](https://github.com/sunrein)

> Written with the narrative tension of The Road and the exquisite terror of classic Stephen King, Bird Box is a propulsive, edge-of-your-seat horror thriller, set in an apocalyptic near-future worldâ€”a masterpiece of suspense from the brilliantly imaginative Josh Malerman.

> Something is out there . . .

> Something terrifying that must not be seen. One glimpse and a person is driven to deadly violence. No one knows what it is or where it came from.

> Five years after it began, a handful of scattered survivors remain, including Malorie and her two young children. Living in an abandoned house near the river, she has dreamed of fleeing to a place where they might be safe. Now, that the boy and girl are four, it is time to go. But the journey ahead will be terrifying: twenty miles downriver in a rowboatâ€”blindfoldedâ€”with nothing to rely on but her wits and the childrenâ€™s trained ears. One wrong choice and they will die. And something is following them. But is it man, animal, or monster?

> Engulfed in darkness, surrounded by sounds both familiar and frightening, Malorie embarks on a harrowing odysseyâ€”a trip that takes her into an unseen world and back into the past, to the companions who once saved her. Under the guidance of the stalwart Tom, a motely group of strangers banded together against the unseen terror, creating order from the chaos. But when supplies ran low, they were forced to venture outsideâ€”and confront the ultimate question: in a world gone mad, who can really be trusted?

> Interweaving past and present, Josh Malermanâ€™s breathtaking debut is a horrific and gripping snapshot of a world unraveled that will have you racing to the final page.

#### [Dracula](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34810834-dracula) (1897) *by [Bram Stoker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bram_Stoker)* [3.97] ðŸŒŸðŸ”¥

Categories: `gothic` `horror` `vampire`

No list of great horror works would be complete without *Dracula*. This is a stunning example of epistolary novels done right, gothic horror done right, and defined an entire genre unto itself. If you are only familiar with Dracula through film or general pop culture references, I can't recommend the source material enough. I knew the basic story beats well before I ever picked the book up, and it still managed to suck me in. If audiobooks are your thing, definintely dry out the Audible full cast recording. - [@thejessleigh](https://github.com/thejessleigh)

> When Jonathan Harker visits Transylvania to help Count Dracula with the purchase of a London house, he makes horrifying discoveries about his client and his castle. Soon afterwards, a number of disturbing incidents unfold in England: an unmanned ship is wrecked at Whitby; strange puncture marks appear on a young womanâ€™s neck; and the inmate of a lunatic asylum raves about the imminent arrival of his â€˜Masterâ€™. In the ensuing battle of wits between the sinister Count Dracula and a determined group of adversaries, Bram Stoker created a masterpiece of the horror genre, probing deeply into questions of human identity and sanity, and illuminating dark corners of Victorian sexuality and desire.

#### [The Haunting of Hill House](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/89717.The_Haunting_of_Hill_House) (1959) *by [Shirley Jackson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shirley_Jackson)* [3.89] ðŸŒŸ

Categories: `gothic` `horror` `haunted house`

A classic of the genre, The Haunting of Hill House is a must read for anyone looking to build their horror repitorie. Calling this deeply psychological and discordant novel a haunted house story simply does it a disservice. It helped establish so many tropes of the genre, yet feels timeless. I find something new every time I read it. - [@thejessleigh](https://github.com/thejessleigh)

> First published in 1959, Shirley Jackson's The Haunting of Hill House has been hailed as a perfect work of unnerving terror. It is the story of four seekers who arrive at a notoriously unfriendly pile called Hill House: Dr. Montague, an occult scholar looking for solid evidence of a "haunting"; Theodora, his lighthearted assistant; Eleanor, a friendless, fragile young woman well acquainted with poltergeists; and Luke, the future heir of Hill House. At first, their stay seems destined to be merely a spooky encounter with inexplicable phenomena. But Hill House is gathering its powersâ€”and soon it will choose one of them to make its own.

#### [House of Leaves](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24800.House_of_Leaves) (2000) *by [Mark Z. Danielewski](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Z._Danielewski)* [4.13]

I first read this book when I was far too young for it to have been appropriate and it did a lot to shape my aesthetic. This beautiful, weird meta-textual novel makes you work, but it sticks with you. This book will fill your dreams with endless hallways and broken promises. An absolute must read. - [@thejessleigh](https://github.com/thejessleigh)

> A blind old man, a young apprentice working in a tattoo shop, and a mad woman haunting an Ohio institute narrate this story of a family that encounters an endlessly shifting series of hallways in their new home, eventually coming face to face with the awful darkness lying at its heart.

## Short Stories

## Movies

#### [Get Out](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt5052448/) (2017) *by [Jordan Peele](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Peele)* [7.8]

Categories: `horror`

The first time I saw this movie I immediately wanted to turn around and see it again. I've never seen a movie where the quality of the performances changes so drastically between the first and second viewings. I won't spoil anything here, but I thought I knew what was going on the first time I watched this. I didn't. I'm not often so caught off guard, horrified, and sickened by a film at the same time. In my opinion, this is a modern masterpiece. - [@thejessleigh](https://github.com/thejessleigh)

> It's time for a young African American to meet with his white girlfriend's parents for a weekend in their secluded estate in the woods, but before long, the friendly and polite ambience will give way to a nightmare.

#### [Rosemary's Baby](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0063522/) (1968) *by [Roman Polanski](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Polanski)* [8.0] ðŸŒŸ

Categories: `drama` `horror` `psychological` `supernatural`

*Rosemary's Baby* creates an atmosphere of doubt, unease, and wrongness from the first few frames that only grows as the movie progresses. It's suffocating and monstrous. Possibly one of the best scary movies of all time. - [@thejessleigh](https://github.com/thejessleigh)

> A young couple move into an apartment, only to be surrounded by peculiar neighbors and occurrences. When the wife becomes mysteriously pregnant, paranoia over the safety of her unborn child begins to control her life.

#### [The Silence of the Lambs](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0102926/) (1991) *by [Jonathan Demme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Demme)* [8.6] ðŸŒŸðŸ”¥

Categories: `crime` `drama` `psychological thriller`

Although the gender politics of Buffalo Bill are outdated and problematic, Anthony Hopkins and Jodie Foster's performances are timeless and elevated *The Silence of the Lambs* to an instant classic. The pacing is slow, deliberate, and methodical in a way that is often immitated but seldom perfected in thrillers. Foster's performance is so tight and so skilled that this movie is watching just for the work she does alone. - [@thejessleigh](https://github.com/thejessleigh)

> A young F.B.I. cadet must confide in an incarcerated and manipulative killer to receive his help on catching another serial killer who skins his victims.

## Television

#### [Hannibal](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2243973) (2013-2015) *by [Bryan Fuller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryan_Fuller)* [8.6]

Categories: `crime` `drama` `psychological thriller`

Hannibal is something of a tone poem. The character development and relationships at the core of the show are the stars here. The show manages to keep you engaged and terrified despite knowing from popular culture where Hannibal Lecter ends up. Plus, the food cinematography is amazing and disturbing. - [@thejessleigh](https://github.com/thejessleigh)

> Explores the early relationship between the renowned psychiatrist and his patient, a young FBI criminal profiler, who is haunted by his ability to empathize with serial killers.

## Comic Books

#### [Through the Woods](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18659623-through-the-woods) (2014) *by [Emily Carroll](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emily_Carroll)* [3.92]

Categories: `horror` `fairy tale`

Emily Carroll does amazing things with color to create a sense of disquiet from the very beginning. I loved the way that she played with sound and movement in some of her panel-less pages. Her stories have a fairy tale quality to them, so each one feels both familiar and new at the same time. This is a beautiful collection full of eerie and unsettling stories. Great for anyone who misses what it feels like to the Grimm's fairy tales for the first time. - [@thejessleigh](https://github.com/thejessleigh)

> Five mysterious, spine-tingling stories follow journeys into (and out of?) the eerie abyss.
These chilling tales spring from the macabre imagination of acclaimed and award-winning comic creator Emily Carroll.
Come take a walk in the woods and see what awaits you there.
